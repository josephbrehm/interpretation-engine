Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for "Dwellings With Basements".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the "Dwellings With Basements" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Dwellings with basements are single-family houses of three stories or less with basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of about 7 feet.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for dwellings with basements are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities affecting the capacity of soil to support a load without movement and on those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are presence of a seasonal high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are flooding, a high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and the amount and size of coarse fragments.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation and restricts the installation of basements, shallow excavations, and lagoons.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is "bedrock (lithic)".

		Not limiting	 not = "unstable fill"
	
	Null local phase is assigned to the Not limiting class.

                15.  Subsidence due to gypsum: Roads, pipelines, and structures built on soils containing gypsum are susceptible to damage from differential settling if the soil gypsum should dissolve to due the addition of more water to the soil than can be removed by evapotranspiration.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution occurs and therefore no subsidence.
* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

		Not limiting	             <3 cm 
	
	Null gypsum is assigned to the Not rated class.
